    <h1>Hi, I'm your good 'ol trusty planet Earth!</h1>
    
    <p>
        The third planet from the sun, Earth is a waterworld, with two-thirds of the 
        planet covered by ocean. It's the only world known to harbor life. Earth's atmosphere 
        is rich in nitrogen and oxygen. Earth's surface rotates about its axis at 
        1,532 feet per second (467 meters per second) — slightly more than 1,000 mph (1,600 kph) — 
        at the equator. The planet zips around the sun at more than 18 miles per second (29 km per second).
