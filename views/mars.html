    <h1>Hi, I'm the original Red Planet Mars!</h1>
    
    <p>
        The fourth planet from the sun is Mars, and it's a cold, desert-like place 
        covered in dust. This dust is made of iron oxides, giving the planet its iconic 
        red hue. Mars shares similarities with Earth: It is rocky, has mountains, valleys 
        and canyons, and storm systems ranging from localized tornado-like dust devils to planet-engulfing dust storms.
        In July 2018, scientists revealed that they had found evidence of a liquid lake beneath the surface of the southern 
        pole's ice cap. It's the first example of a persistent body of water on the Red Planet.
